# TCP socket interaction between client and server

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.

This project has a basic script for communication between client and server. Message and file transfer is possible.
